Slightly chop a few pieces of lettuce into bite-sized chunks.
Dice a few tomatoes. Donâ€™t make them too small; the slices should be large enough to pick up
with a fork.
Peel the cucumber and put into half slices.
Cut the onion and then separate. Keep only pieces large enough to eat easily.

In a large bowl add the lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and onion slices.
