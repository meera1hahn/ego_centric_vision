1
Take an individual tomato and cut it into slices. Set aside and repeat for more tomato slices (1
large tomato cut into slices is usually enough).
If your lettuce is pre-separated in a bag remove a few pieces.
If your lettuce is in a bunch (a head of lettuce) tear off a few pieces of lettuce.
Cut each piece into a manageable size which would fit on a bread slice.
2
Take a slice of bread and put it on a plate. 
Place a few slices of turkey on the slice of bread.
Put the lettuce and tomato slices on top of the turkey.
Add a cheese slice or two.
Garnish with ketchup, mustard, or mayo if desired.
Top with the remaining bread slice to finish the sandwich.
